# Platformer-Test-Game
Small platforming game to test out how Unity works WIP.

Hoping to use this as a base for a game I've been wanting to make for a while. Once I get to grips with how Unity works through this project, I'll either
tranisition this repo into the full game slowly or make a new repo to carry on development.
